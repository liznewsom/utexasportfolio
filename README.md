Purpose: To preform a replication and an analysis of "Exchange rate risk and commodity trade between U.S. and India: an asymmetry analysis" by Mohsen Bahmani-Oskooee & Sujata Saha, 2020
         linear multivariable regression models with then novel contributions of an expanded time range and the coding langauges R and Python.

Our Study: Exchange Rate Risk and Commodity Trade Between U.S. and India and  U.S. and Canada 
  We replicated the first two regression equations for "Exchange rate risk and commodity trade between U.S. and India: an asymmetry analysis" by Mohsen Bahmani-Oskooee & Sujata Saha, 2020 in Python and R for a total of four linear multivariable regressions with the addition of Python data visulaizations.
  We selected ten commodities for which data was readily available and these were also the common top contributors to the trade relations under analysis.
  The Python linear multivariable regression models provided key R-squared scores, P scores, and Z scores for the analysis. 
  The R confirmed and was used for the F-test
  Strong multicollinearity occurred for each Python regression presumably due to the similarities between the Real Exchange Rate (REX) and the Volatility (VOL) variables. 
  The results seem to be affected by the choice of commodities.
